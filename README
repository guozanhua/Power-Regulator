Power Regulator is one virtualized cluster management software, which is used to 
cap power in heterogeneous virtualized cluster. It is implemented with C and deployed
in Xen based virtualized environment.
The motivation of this work is power peaking caused by GPU based VM execution, increasing
the maximum configured power of PDU (power distributed unit). Therefore, the proposed 
Power Regulator, caps the maximum power within tolerated performance degradation.
