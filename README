Power Regulator is one virtualized cluster management software, which is used to 
cap power in heterogeneous virtualized cluster. It is implemented with C and deployed
in Xen based virtualized environment.
The motivation of this work is power peaking caused by GPU based VM execution, increasing
the maximum configured power of PDU (power distributed unit). Therefore, the proposed 
Power Regulator, caps the maximum power within tolerated performance degradation.
Requirement:
(a). All physical machine should based on Xen virtualzied environment with xend(xm) and xenpm module support. 
(b). "eth0" should be used as NIC.
(c). Physical machine should connect with wattsup device for power monitoring. The connected 
     interface is ttyUSB0.
